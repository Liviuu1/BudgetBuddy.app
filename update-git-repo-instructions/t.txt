To update your local Git repository with the changes your colleague made on the master branch, you can follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to your project directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and use the `cd` command to go to the directory where your Git project is located.

2. **Check the status of your local repository:** Before pulling the changes, it's a good idea to make sure your working directory is clean. You can use the following command to check the status of your repository:

   ```
   git status
   ```

   Make sure there are no uncommitted changes in your local repository. If you have uncommitted changes, you should either commit them or stash them to avoid conflicts when pulling.

3. **Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:** Use the following command to fetch the latest changes from the remote repository (which includes the changes your colleague made):

   ```
   git fetch origin
   ```

   This command updates your local copy of the remote repository without making any changes to your working directory.

4. **Switch to the master branch:** If you are not already on the master branch, switch to it using the following command:

   ```
   git checkout master
   ```

5. **Merge the changes from the remote master branch:** Use the following command to merge the changes from the remote master branch into your local master branch:

   ```
   git merge origin/master
   ```
   
   If there are no conflicts, Git will automatically merge the changes into your local branch. If there are conflicts, you'll need to resolve them manually. Git will guide you through the conflict resolution process.

6. **Test your project:** After merging the changes, it's a good practice to test your project to ensure everything works as expected.

7. **Commit the merge:** If there were no conflicts to resolve, you can commit the merge using the following command:

   ```
   git commit -m "Merged changes from origin/master"
   ```

8. **Push the changes to the remote repository:** If you want to make these changes available to your colleague and the rest of the team, you should push them to the remote repository with the following command:

   ```
   git push origin master
   ```

Now your local repository should be up to date with the changes made by your colleague on the master branch. You can continue working on the project or collaborate with your team as needed.
